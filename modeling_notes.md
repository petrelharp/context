Notes:

1. Polarization can be a problem -- for instance, for a two-taxon tree although in principle
    a mutation occurring on one branch is distinguishable from the *reverse* mutation occurring on the other branch
    if ancestral frequencies are assumed known, this requires in practice a large number of mutations.

2. Mutational signatures -- if we extend the model to allow signatures (like `selfactors`) with a single coefficient,
    this could allow multistage modeling of, say, fixing the number of signatures then alternating updating the signatures
    and their relative intensities.

3. We ought to allow negative mutation rates.

4. Also, include gaps.
