% Abstract: 
% It is well-known that the nucleotide mutation process is context-dependent:
% the probability of change at a particular base depends not only on the
% nucleotide at that position, but also at its neighbors; CpG hypermutability
% is the most well-known such effect.  Selection for or against particular
% motifs adds more layers of context dependencies to the nucleotide
% substitution process.  Incorporating context dependence is difficult, because
% this in principle requires summing over all possible substitutions at all
% sites.  I will present a computaionally feasible method to do these
% calculations correctly, which enables Bayesian inference of phylogenetic
% branch lengths, mutation rates, and selection coefficients of short motifs.
% I will also illustrate with examples to some models of statistical physics,
% such as estimation of the magnetization and temperature in the Ising model.
