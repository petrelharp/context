Totally right - I've fixed this.

I'd like to not totally explain the units here,
so have changed this to:
"Here $\beta$ controls the strength of coupling between neighboring dipoles,
and $\gamma$ controls the strength of an external magnetic field (and both are
scaled by temperature)."

Hm, good point -- I've changed $k$ to $j$ in cases 2 and 3,
but don't want to invent totally new notation;
having it be clear but a little unwieldy is OK at this point, I think.

Hm - I'd like to make this more clear, but we already have the statement
"Note that this is equivalent to saying that possible changes occur at rate $\mu^*$
independently at each of the L sites",
which is how I was going to clarify it.

Fixed, as with Reviewer 2.

Good idea, but then we'd have something like $x^{(h)}_i = u$,
which is equality of two $h$-vectors,
but writing it that way doesn't make it obvious that it's equality of vectors,
not of since bases.
I'd like to be pedantic at the top of page 6
just to be clear.

Whoops, so it is!

Heh, yes, it sure is.
