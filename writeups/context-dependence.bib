@misc{bhadra2015horseshoe,
  abstract = {We propose a new prior for ultra-sparse signal detection that we term the
"horseshoe+ prior." The horseshoe+ prior is a natural extension of the
horseshoe prior that has achieved success in the estimation and detection of
sparse signals and has been shown to possess a number of desirable theoretical
properties while enjoying computational feasibility in high dimensions. The
horseshoe+ prior builds upon these advantages. Our work proves that the
horseshoe+ posterior concentrates at a rate faster than that of the horseshoe
in the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) sense. We also establish theoretically that the
proposed estimator has lower posterior mean squared error in estimating signals
compared to the horseshoe and achieves the optimal Bayes risk in testing up to
a constant. For global-local scale mixture priors, we develop a new technique
for analyzing the marginal sparse prior densities using the class of Meijer-G
functions. In simulations, the horseshoe+ estimator demonstrates superior
performance in a standard design setting against competing methods, including
the horseshoe and Dirichlet-Laplace estimators. We conclude with an
illustration on a prostate cancer data set and by pointing out some directions
for future research.},

@article{yang1994maximum,
  abstract = {Two approximate methods are proposed for maximum likelihood phylogenetic estimation, which allow variable rates of substitution across nucleotide sites. Three data sets with quite different characteristics were analyzed to examine empirically the performance of these methods. The first, called the "discrete gamma model," uses several categories of rates to approximate the gamma distribution, with equal probability for each category. The mean of each category is used to represent all the rates falling in the category. The performance of this method is found to be quite good, and four such categories appear to be sufficient to produce both an optimum, or near-optimum fit by the model to the data, and also an acceptable approximation to the continuous distribution. The second method, called "fixed-rates model", classifies sites into several classes according to their rates predicted assuming the star tree. Sites in different classes are then assumed to be evolving at these fixed rates when other tree topologies are evaluated. Analyses of the data sets suggest that this method can produce reasonable results, but it seems to share some properties of a least-squares pairwise comparison; for example, interior branch lengths in nonbest trees are often found to be zero. The computational requirements of the two methods are comparable to that of Felsenstein's (1981, J Mol Evol 17:368-376) model, which assumes a single rate for all the sites.},

@article{neyman1933problem,
  abstract = { The problem of testing statistical hypotheses is an old one. Its origin is usually onnected with the name of THOMAS BAYES, who gave the well-known theorem on the probabilities a posterior of the possible " causes '. of a given event.* Since then it has been discussed by many writers of whom we shall here mention two only, BERTRANDt     and BOREL,Jwhose differing views serve well to illustrate the point from which we shall approachthe subject.  BERTRAND into statistical form a variety of hypotheses, as for example the put hypothesis that a given group of stars with relatively small angular distances between them as seen from the earth, form a " system" or group in space. His method of attack, which is that in common use, consisted essentially in calculating the probability, P, that a certain character,x, of the observed facts would ariseif the hypothesis tested were true. If P were very small, this would generally be considered as an indication that the hypothesis, H, was probably false, and vice versa. BERTRAND           expressed the pessimistic view that no test of this kind could give reliable results.  BOREL,  however, in a later discussion, consideredthat the method describedcould be applied with success provided that the character,x, of the observed facts were properly chosen-were, in fact, a characterwhich he terms " en quelque sorte remarquable." We appear to find disagreement here, but are inclined to think that, as is so often the case, the difference arises because the two writers are not really considering precisely the same problem. In general terms the problem is this: Is it possible that there are any efficient tests of hypotheses based upon the theory of probability, and if so, what is their nature ? Before trying to answer this question, we must attempt to get closer to its exact meaning. In the first place, it is evident that the hypotheses to be tested by means of the theory of probability must concern in some way the probabilities of the differentkinds of results of certain trials. That is to say, they must be of a statistical nature, or as we shall say later on, they must be statistical hypotheses.  Now what is the precise meaning of the words " an efficient test of a hypothesis ? " There may be several meanings. For example, we may consider some specified hypothesis, as that concerning the group of stars, and look for a method which we should hope to tell us, with regard to a particular group of stars, whether they form a system, or are grouped " by chance," their mutual distances apart being enormous and their relative movements unrelated.

@article{kimura1962probability,
  abstract = {HE success or failure of a mutant gene in a population is dependent not only
Ton selectio2 but also on chance. This fact was first treated quantitatively by
FISHER (1922) who later (1930) worked out the probability of ultimate survival
of a mutant gene for the case of genic selection (i.e. no dominance). Equivalent
results have been obtained by HALDANE (1927) and WRIGHT (1931). Also the
probability was estimated for a recessive mutant gene by HALDANE (1927) and
WRIGHT ( 1942).
The present author (KIMURA 1957) extended these results to include any level
of dominance. The probability of eventual fixation, U (p) , was expressed in terms
of the initial frequency, p, the selection coefficients, and the effective population
number. This function was used by ROBERTSON (1960) in his theory of selection
limits in plant and animal breeding.
The purpose of this note is to present a more general formula for ~(p) which
exompasses random fluctuations in selection intensity as well as random drift
because of small population number. It will also be used to solve a question
relating to âquasi-fixationâ posed by the author in 1955. },

@article{glemin2015quantification,
  abstract = {Much evidence indicates that GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) has a major impact on the evolution of mammalian genomes. However, a detailed quantification of the process is still lacking. The strength of gBGC can be measured from the analysis of derived allele frequency spectra (DAF), but this approach is sensitive to a number of confounding factors. In particular, we show by simulations that the inference is pervasively affected by polymorphism polarization errors and by spatial heterogeneity in gBGC strength. We propose a new general method to quantify gBGC from DAF spectra, incorporating polarization errors, taking spatial heterogeneity into account, and jointly estimating mutation bias. Applying it to human polymorphism data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we show that the strength of gBGC does not differ between hypermutable CpG sites and non-CpG sites, suggesting that in humans gBGC is not caused by the base-excision repair machinery. Genome-wide, the intensity of gBGC is in the nearly neutral area. However, given that recombination occurs primarily within recombination hotspots, 1\%-2\% of the human genome is subject to strong gBGC. On average, gBGC is stronger in African than in non-African populations, reflecting differences in effective population sizes. However, due to more heterogeneous recombination landscapes, the fraction of the genome affected by strong gBGC is larger in non-African than in African populations. Given that the location of recombination hotspots evolves very rapidly, our analysis predicts that, in the long term, a large fraction of the genome is affected by short episodes of strong gBGC.},

  abstract = {Author summary Genetic variation among humans is built up by a constant stream of new mutations. New mutations appear every generation because of unrepaired DNA damage, or copying errors in DNA replication. Differences between populations in the rate or types of mutations that appear are one of several factors that affect patterns of genetic variation. Here, we examined genomes from all major world populations, looking at patterns of variation to see whether different types of rare variant were more common in different parts of the world. We found two types of variant that had this property. The first is more common in Western Eurasia than in other parts of the world and seems to be related to an historical increase in the rate of a specific kind of mutation. The second type of variantâC>T changes at CpG sitesâis more common in Native Americans, not because mutation rates are different, but because these mutations occur at a very high rate, and this kind of variation is very sensitive to differences in demographic history between populations. These results demonstrate the importance of considering both mutation and demography in the interpretation of genetic variation.},

@article{harris2015evidence,
  abstract = {As humans dispersed out of Africa they adapted to new environmental challenges, including changes in exposure to mutagenic solar radiation. Humans in temperate latitudes have acquired light skin that is relatively transparent to UV light, and some evidence suggests that their DNA damage response pathways have also experienced local adaptation. This raises the possibility that different populations have experienced different selective pressures affecting genome integrity. Here, I present evidence that the rate of a particular mutation type has recently increased in the European population, rising in frequency by 50\% during the 40,000â80,000 y since Europeans began diverging from Asians. A comparison of SNPs private to Africa, Asia, and Europe in the 1000 Genomes data reveals that private European variation is enriched for the transition 5â²-TCC-3â²âââ5â²-TTC-3â². Although it is not clear whether UV played a causal role in changing the European mutational spectrum, 5â²-TCC-3â²âââ5â²-TTC-3â² is known to be the most common somatic mutation present in melanoma skin cancers, as well as the mutation most frequently induced in vitro by UV. Regardless of its causality, this change indicates that DNA replication fidelity has not remained stable even since the origin of modern humans and might have changed numerous times during our recent evolutionary history.},

@article{harris2016rapid,
  abstract = {DNA is a remarkably precise medium for copying and storing biological information, with a mutation rate in humans of about 1e-8 per base pair per generation. This extraordinary fidelity results from the combined action of hundreds of genes involved in DNA replication and proofreading, and repair of spontaneous damage. Recent studies of cancer have shown that mutation of specific genes often leads to characteristic mutational "signatures"--i.e., increased mutation rates within particular sequence contexts. We therefore hypothesized that more subtle variation in replication or repair genes within natural populations might also lead to differences in mutational signatures. As a proxy for mutational input, we examined SNV variation across human and other great ape populations. Remarkably we found that mutational spectra differ substantially among species, human continental groups and even, in some cases, between closely-related populations. Closer examination of one such signal, an increased rate of TCC-\>TTC mutations reported previously in Europeans, indicates a burst of mutations from about 15,000 to 2,000 years ago, perhaps due to the appearance, drift, and ultimate elimination of a genetic modifier of mutation rate.},

  abstract = {Author Summary Somatic (non-inherited) mutations are acquired throughout our lives in cells throughout our body. These mutations can be caused, for example, by DNA replication errors or exposure to environmental mutagens such as tobacco smoke. Some of these mutations can lead to cancer. Different cancers, and even different instances of the same cancer, can show different distinctive patterns of somatic mutations. These distinctive patterns have become known as âmutation signaturesâ. For example, C > A mutations are frequent in lung caners whereas C > T and CC > TT mutations are frequent in skin cancers. Each mutation signature may be associated with a specific kind of carcinogen, such as tobacco smoke or ultraviolet light. Identifying mutation signatures therefore has the potential to identify new carcinogens, and yield new insights into the mechanisms and causes of cancer, In this paper, we introduce new statistical tools for tackling this important problem. These tools provide more robust and interpretable mutation signatures compared to previous approaches, as we demonstrate by applying them to large-scale cancer genomic data.},

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the rapidly evolving zinc-finger protein PRDM9 binds to this motif and that sequence changes in the protein may be responsible for hotspot differences between species.

  abstract = {Meiosis is a potentially important source of germline mutations, as sites of meiotic recombination experience recurrent double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, evidence for a local mutagenic effect of recombination from population sequence data has been equivocal, likely because mutation is only one of several forces shaping sequence variation. By sequencing large numbers of single crossover molecules obtained from human sperm for two recombination hotspots, we find direct evidence that recombination is mutagenic: Crossovers carry more de novo mutations than nonrecombinant DNA molecules analyzed for the same donors and hotspots. The observed mutations were primarily CG to TA transitions, with a higher frequency of transitions at CpG than non-CpGs sites. This enrichment of mutations at CpG sites at hotspots could predominate in methylated regions involving frequent single-stranded DNA processing as part of DSB repair. In addition, our data set provides evidence that GC alleles are preferentially transmitted during crossing over, opposing mutation, and shows that GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) predominates over mutation in the sequence evolution of hotspots. These findings are consistent with the idea that gBGC could be an adaptation to counteract the mutational load of recombination.},

Many Y-family members carry out aberrant DNA synthesisâpoor replication accuracy, the favored formation of non-Watson-Crick base pairs, efficient mismatch extension, and most importantly, an ability to replicate through DNA damage. This review is devoted primarily to a discussion of Y-family polymerase members that exhibit error-prone behavior. Roles for these remarkable enzymes occur in widely disparate DNA repair pathways, such as UV-induced mutagenesis, adaptive mutation, avoidance of skin cancer, and induction of somatic cell hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes. Individual polymerases engaged in multiple repair pathways pose challenging questions about their roles in targeting and trafficking. Macromolecular assemblies of replication-repair âfactoriesâ could enable a cell to handle the complex logistics governing the rapid migration and exchange of polymerases. },

DNA is certainly one of the key targets for UV-induced damage in a variety of organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. UV radiation induces two of the most abundant mutagenic and cytotoxic DNA lesions such as cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photoproducts (6-4PPs) and their Dewar valence isomers. However{,} cells have developed a number of repair or tolerance mechanisms to counteract the DNA damage caused by UV or any other stressors. Photoreactivation with the help of the enzyme photolyase is one of the most important and frequently occurring repair mechanisms in a variety of organisms. Excision repair{,} which can be distinguished into base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair (NER){,} also plays an important role in DNA repair in several organisms with the help of a number of glycosylases and polymerases{,} respectively. In addition{,} mechanisms such as mutagenic repair or dimer bypass{,} recombinational repair{,} cell-cycle checkpoints{,} apoptosis and certain alternative repair pathways are also operative in various organisms. This review deals with UV-induced DNA damage and the associated repair mechanisms as well as methods of detecting DNA damage and its future perspectives.},

  abstract = {DNA polymerase Î¹ (Pol Î¹) is an attractive candidate for somatic hypermutation in antibody genes because of its low fidelity. To identify a role for Pol Î¹, we analyzed mutations in two strains of mice with deficiencies in the enzyme: 129 mice with negligible expression of truncated Pol Î¹, and knock-in mice that express full-length Pol Î¹ that is catalytically inactive. Both strains had normal frequencies and spectra of mutations in the variable region, indicating that loss of Pol Î¹ did not change overall mutagenesis. We next examined if Pol Î¹ affected tandem mutations generated by another error-prone polymerase, Pol Î¶. The frequency of contiguous mutations was analyzed using a novel computational model to determine if they occur during a single DNA transaction or during two independent events. Analyses of 2,000 mutations from both strains indicated that Pol Î¹-compromised mice lost the tandem signature, whereas C57BL/6 mice accumulated significant amounts of double mutations. The results support a model where Pol Î¹ occasionally accesses the replication fork to generate a first mutation, and Pol Î¶ extends the mismatch with a second mutation.},

initiating somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class-switch recombination (CSR) during

FRET, we show that AID binds to transcribed dsDNA and translocates
unidirectionally in concert with RNA polymerase (RNAP) on moving transcription bubbles,

Our analysis distinguishes dynamic scanning from static ssDNA creasing. That AID alone can
track along with RNAP during transcription and scan within stalled transcription bubbles

Although DNA repair processes rapidly target the damaged DNA for repair, some lesions nevertheless persist and block genome duplication by the cell's replicase. To avoid the deleterious consequence of a stalled replication fork, cells use specialized polymerases to traverse the damage. This process, termed "translesion DNA synthesis" (TLS), affords the cell additional time to repair the damage before the replicase returns to complete genome duplication. In many cases, this damage-tolerance mechanism is error-prone, and cell survival is often associated with an increased risk of mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. Despite being tightly regulated by a variety of transcriptional and posttranslational controls, the low-fidelity TLS polymerases also gain access to undamaged DNA where their inaccurate synthesis may actually be beneficial for genetic diversity and evolutionary fitness.},

These dynamics are scientifically and clinically important. After highlighting the remarkable characteristics of naive and experienced B-cell repertoires, especially biased usage of genes encoding the B-cell receptors, we contrast methods of sequence analysis and their attempts to explain patterns of B-cell evolution. These phylogenetic approaches are currently unlinked to explicit models of B-cell competition, which analyse repertoire evolution at the level of phenotype, the affinities and specificities to particular antigenic sites. The models, in turn, suggest how chance, infection history and other factors contribute to different patterns of immunodominance and protection between people.

When these errors occur in cells that lead to the production of gametes they can be incorporated into the germline. Such germline mutations are the basis of evolutionary change; however, to date there has been little attempt to quantify the extent of genetic variation in human populations in the rate at which they occur. This is particularly important because new spontaneous mutations are thought to make an important contribution to many human diseases. Here we present a new way to identify genetic loci that may be associated with an elevated rate of germline mutation and report the application of this method to data from a large number of human genomes, generated by the 1000 Genomes Project. Several of the candidate loci we report are in or near genes involved in DNA repair.},

Multiple distinct single- and double-nucleotide substitution signatures were discernible. Cancers with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations exhibited a characteristic combination of substitution mutation signatures and a distinctive profile of deletions. Complex relationships between somatic mutation prevalence and transcription were detected. A remarkable phenomenon of localized hypermutation, termed "kataegis," was observed. Regions of kataegis differed between cancers but usually colocalized with somatic rearrangements. Base substitutions in these regions were almost exclusively of cytosine at TpC dinucleotides. The mechanisms underlying most of these mutational signatures are unknown. However, a role for the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases is proposed.},

  abstract = {Functional antibody genes are assembled by V-D-J joining and then diversified by somatic hypermutation. This hypermutation results from stepwise incorporation of single nucleotide substitutions into the V gene, underpinning much of antibody diversity and affinity maturation. Hypermutation is triggered by activation-induced deaminase (AID), an enzyme which catalyzes targeted deamination of deoxycytidine residues in DNA. The pathways used for processing the AID-generated U:G lesions determine the variety of base substitutions observed during somatic hypermutation. Thus, DNA replication across the uracil yields transition mutations at C:G pairs, whereas uracil excision by UNG uracil-DNA glycosylase creates abasic sites that can also yield transversions. Recognition of the U:G mismatch by MSH2/MSH6 triggers a mutagenic patch repair in which polymerase eta plays a major role and leads to mutations at A:T pairs. AID-triggered DNA deamination also underpins immunoglobulin variable (IgV) gene conversion, isotype class switching, and some oncogenic translocations in B cell tumors.},

Methylated CpG (mCpG) sequences frequently undergo mutation resulting in a general depletion of this dinucleotide sequence in mammalian genomes. In human genetic disease- and cancer-relevant genes, mCpG sequences are mutational hotspots. It is an almost universally accepted dogma that these mutations are caused by random deamination of 5-methylcytosines. However, it is plausible that mCpG transitions are not caused simply by spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine in double-stranded DNA but by other processes including, for example, mCpG-specific base modification by endogenous or exogenous mutagens or, alternatively, by secondary factors operating at mCpG sequences and promoting deamination. We also discuss that mCpG sequences are favored targets for specific exogenous mutagens and carcinogens. When adjacent to another pyrimidine, 5-methylcytosine preferentially undergoes sunlight-induced pyrimidine dimer formation. Certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons form guanine adducts and induce G to T transversion mutations with high selectivity at mCpG sequences.},

We first use genetic parentage information on a large number of wild chimpanzees and mountain gorillas to directly infer their average generation times. We then compare these generation time estimates with those of humans and apply recent estimates of the human mutation rate per generation to derive estimates of split times of great apes and humans that are independent of fossil calibration. We date the humanâchimpanzee split to at least 7â8 million years and the population split between Neanderthals and modern humans to 400,000â800,000 y ago. This suggests that molecular divergence dates may not be in conflict with the attribution of 6- to 7-million-y-old fossils to the human lineage and 400,000-y-old fossils to the Neanderthal lineage.},

  abstract = {Gorillas are humans' closest living relatives after chimpanzees, and are of comparable importance for the study of human origins and evolution. Here we present the assembly and analysis of a genome sequence for the western lowland gorilla, and compare the whole genomes of all extant great ape genera. We propose a synthesis of genetic and fossil evidence consistent with placing the human-chimpanzee and human-chimpanzee-gorilla speciation events at approximately 6 and 10 million years ago. In 30\% of the genome, gorilla is closer to human or chimpanzee than the latter are to each other; this is rarer around coding genes, indicating pervasive selection throughout great ape evolution, and has functional consequences in gene expression. A comparison of protein coding genes reveals approximately 500 genes showing accelerated evolution on each of the gorilla, human and chimpanzee lineages, and evidence for parallel acceleration, particularly of genes involved in hearing. We also compare the western and eastern gorilla species, estimating an average sequence divergence time 1.75 million years ago, but with evidence for more recent genetic exchange and a population bottleneck in the eastern species. The use of the genome sequence in these and future analyses will promote a deeper understanding of great ape biology and evolution.},

  abstract = {We develop an approximate maximum likelihood method to estimate flanking nucleotide context-dependent mutation rates and amino acid exchange-dependent selection in orthologous protein-coding sequences and use it to analyze genome-wide coding sequence alignments from mammals and yeast. Allowing context-dependent mutation provides a better fit to coding sequence data than simpler (context-independent or CpG "hotspot") models and significantly affects selection parameter estimates. Allowing asymmetric (nonreciprocal) selection on amino acid exchanges gives a better fit than simple dN/dS or symmetric selection models. Relative selection strength estimates from our models show good agreement with independent estimates derived from human disease-causing and engineered mutations. Selection strengths depend on local protein structure, showing expected biophysical trends in helical versus nonhelical regions and increased asymmetry on polar-hydrophobic exchanges with increased burial. The more stringent selection that has previously been observed for highly expressed proteins is primarily concentrated in buried regions, supporting the notion that such proteins are under stronger than average selection for stability. Our analyses indicate that a highly parameterized model of mutation and selection is computationally tractable and is a useful tool for exploring a variety of biological questions concerning protein and coding sequence evolution.},

  abstract = {Hidden Markov random fields represent a complex hierarchical model, where the
hidden latent process is an undirected graphical structure. Performing inference for
such models is difficult primarily because the likelihood of the hidden states is often
unavailable. The main contribution of this article is to present approximate methods
to calculate the likelihood for large lattices based on exact methods for smaller lat-
tices. We introduce approximate likelihood methods by relaxing some of the dependen-
cies in the latent model, and also by extending tractable approximations to the likeli-
hood, the so-called pseudolikelihood approximations, for a large lattice partitioned into
smaller sublattices. Results are presented based on simulated data as well as inference
for the temporal-spatial structure of the interaction between up- and down-regulated
states within the mitochondrial chromosome of the Plasmodium falciparum organism.

@article{besag1986statistical,
  abstract = {A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or
"pixels", each pixel having a particular "colour" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The
true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly
multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a
known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional
knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper,
it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a non-
degenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by
Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However,
the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable large-
scale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is
proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is
illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the
assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed.
Potential applications are mentioned briefly.},

reservoir) which causes them to change their states randomly with time. Coupling between the spins

the values of the neighboring spins. This dependence is determined, in part, by the detailed balancing
condItion obeyed by the equihbnum state of the model. The Markoff process which describes the
spin functions is analyzed in detail for the case of a closed N-member chain. The expectation values
of the individual spins and of the products of pairs of spins, each of the pair evaluated at a different

IS dIscussed, and the frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility is found in the weak-field limit.
Some fluctuation-dissipation theorems are derived which relate the susceptibility to the Fourier

The former, conditional probability definition, whilst the more intuitively attractive, presents several basic problems, not least in the identification of available models. In this paper, conditional probability nearest-neighbour systems for interacting random variables on a two-dimensional rectangular lattice are examined. It is shown that, in the case of 0, 1 variables and a homogeneous system, the only possibility is a logistic-type model but in which the explanatory variables at a point are the surrounding array variables themselves. A spatial-temporal approach leading to the same model is also suggested. The final section deals with linear nearest-neighbour systems, especially for continuous variables.

@article{geman1984stochastic,
  abstract = {We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

@article{pickard1982inference,
  abstract = {In previous papers (1976), (1977a), (1979) limit theorems were obtained for the classical Ising model, and these provided the basis for asymptotic inference. The present paper extends these results to more general Ising models. In two and more dimensions, likelihood inference for the thermodynamic parameters (i.e. the interaction energies) is effectively impossible. The problem is that the error in locating critical and/or confidence regions is as large as their diameters. To remedy this requires more accurate characterizations of the partition functions, but these seem unlikely to be forthcoming. Besag's coding estimators for these parameters are inverse hyperbolic tangents of the roots of simultaneous polynomial equations and hence avoid such location errors. However, little is yet known about their sampling characteristics. Finally, likelihood inference for lattice averages (an alternative parametrization) is straightforward from the limit theorems.},

  abstract = {Several lessons about the process of calibration were learned during development of a self-modifying
cellular automaton model to predict urban growth. This model, part of a global change research project
on human-induced land transformations, was used to predict the spatial extent of urban growth 100 years
into the future. The context of the prediction was to evaluate urban environmental disturbances such as
land use conversion, urban heat island intensification, and greenhouse gas generation. Using data for the
San Francisco Bay area as a test case, methods were developed, including interactive and statistical
versions of the model, animation and visualization tools, automated testing methods, and Monte Carlo
simulations. This presentation will enumerate, analyze, and discuss the lessons learned during the
extensive process of model calibration. Experience with the methods developed may have broader use in
assisting the rigorous calibration for other CA models, and perhaps those coupled environmental models
with an extensive spatial data component. These methods are now under test as the project moves to a
new data set for the Washington, D.C.-Baltimore area.},

heuristic until recent e V orts to incorporate multi-criteria evaluation and arti cial

which derives its initial probability of simulation from observed sequential land

local rules based on the strength of neighbourhood development. Consequentially
the integration of global (static) and local (dynamic) factors produces more realistic

  abstract = {Strand-symmetric relative abundance functionals for di-, tri-, and tetranucleotides are introduced and applied to sequences encompassing a broad phylogenetic range to discern tendencies and anomalies in the occurrences of these short oligonucleotides within and between genomic sequences. For dinucleotides, TA is almost universally under-represented, with the exception of vertebrate mitochondrial genomes, and CG is strongly under-represented in vertebrates and in mitochondrial genomes. The traditional methylation/deamination/mutation hypothesis for the rarity of CG does not adequately account for the observed deficiencies in certain sequences, notably the mitochondrial genomes, yeast, and Neurospora crassa, which lack the standard CpG methylase. Homodinucleotides (AA.TT, CC.GG) and larger homooligonucleotides are over-represented in many organisms, perhaps due to polymerase slippage events. For trinucleotides, GCA.TGC tends to be under-represented in phage, human viral, and eukaryotic sequences, and CTA.TAG is strongly under-represented in many prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and viral sequences. The CCA.TGG triplet is ubiquitously over-represented in human viral and eukaryotic sequences. Among the tetranucleotides, several four-base-pair palindromes tend to be under-represented in phage sequences, probably as a means of restriction avoidance. The tetranucleotide CTAG is observed to be rare in virtually all bacterial genomes and some phage genomes. Explanations for these over- and under-representations in terms of DNA/RNA structures and regulatory mechanisms are considered.},

@article{yaari2013models,
  abstract = {Analyses of somatic hypermutation (SHM) patterns in B cell immunoglobulin (Ig) sequences contribute to our basic understanding of adaptive immunity, and have broad applications not only for understanding the immune response to pathogens, but also to determining the role of SHM in autoimmunity and B cell cancers. Although stochastic, SHM displays intrinsic biases that can confound statistical analysis, especially when combined with the particular codon usage and base composition in Ig sequences. Analysis of B cell clonal expansion, diversification, and selection processes thus critically depends on an accurate background model for SHM micro-sequence targeting (i.e., hot/cold-spots) and nucleotide substitution. Existing models are based on small numbers of sequences/mutations, in part because they depend on data from non-coding regions or non-functional sequences to remove the confounding influences of selection. Here, we combine high-throughput Ig sequencing with new computational analysis methods to produce improved models of SHM targeting and substitution that are based only on synonymous mutations, and are thus independent of selection. The resulting âS5Fâ models are based on 806,860 Synonymous mutations in 5-mer motifs from 1,145,182 Functional sequences and account for dependencies on the adjacent four nucleotides (two bases upstream and downstream of the mutation). The estimated profiles can explain almost half of the variance in observed mutation patterns, and clearly show that both mutation targeting and substitution are significantly influenced by neighboring bases. While mutability and substitution profiles were highly conserved across individuals, the variability across motifs was found to be much larger than previously estimated.

The importance of having the rate at which a point mutation occurs depend on the DNA sequence at sites surrounding the mutation is now better appreciated and can be accommodated in probabilistic models of protein evolution. To quantify the evolutionary impact of some aspect of phenotype, one promising strategy is to develop a system for predicting phenotype from the DNA sequence and to then infer how the evolutionary rates of sequence change are affected by the predicted phenotypic consequences of the changes. Although statistical tools for characterizing protein evolution are improving, the list of candidate phenomena that can affect rates of protein evolution is long and the relative contributions of these phenomena are only beginning to be disentangled. },

@article{schaibley2013influence,
  abstract = {Understanding patterns of spontaneous mutations is of fundamental interest in studies of human genome evolution and genetic disease. Here, we used extremely rare variants in humans to model the molecular spectrum of single-nucleotide mutations. Compared to common variants in humans and human-chimpanzee fixed differences (substitutions), rare variants, on average, arose more recently in the human lineage and are less affected by the potentially confounding effects of natural selection, population demographic history, and biased gene conversion. We analyzed variants obtained from a population-based sequencing study of 202 genes in >14,000 individuals. We observed considerable variability in the per-gene mutation rate, which was correlated with local GC content, but not recombination rate. Using >20,000 variants with a derived allele frequency â¤10(-4), we examined the effect of local GC content and recombination rate on individual variant subtypes and performed comparisons with common variants and substitutions. The influence of local GC content on rare variants differed from that on common variants or substitutions, and the differences varied by variant subtype. Furthermore, recombination rate and recombination hotspots have little effect on rare variants of any subtype, yet both have a relatively strong impact on multiple variant subtypes in common variants and substitutions. This observation is consistent with the effect of biased gene conversion or selection-dependent processes. Our results highlight the distinct biases inherent in the initial mutation patterns and subsequent evolutionary processes that affect segregating variants.},

@article{schrider2011pervasive,

However, it is still often assumed that single-nucleotide mutations are independent of one another, each being caused by separate mutational events. The occurrence of multiple, closely spaced substitutions appears to violate assumptions of independence and is often interpreted as evidence for the action of adaptive natural selection [2, 3], balancing selection [4], or compensatory evolution [5, 6]. Here we provide evidence of a frequent, widespread multinucleotide mutational process active throughout eukaryotes. Genomic data from mutation-accumulation experiments, parent-offspring trios, and human polymorphisms all show that simultaneous nucleotide substitutions occur within short stretches of DNA. Regardless of species, such multinucleotide mutations (MNMs) consistently comprise \~3\% of the total number of nucleotide substitutions. These results imply that previous adaptive interpretations of multiple, closely spaced substitutions may have been unwarranted and that MNMs must be considered when interpreting sequence data.},

@article{terekhanova2013prevalence,
  abstract = {Evolution of sequences mostly involves independent changes at different sites. However, substitutions at neighboring sites may co-occur as multinucleotide replacement events (MNRs). Here, we compare noncoding sequences of several species of primates, and of three species of Drosophila fruit flies, in a phylogenetic analysis of the replacements that occurred between species at nearby nucleotide sites. Both in primates and in Drosophila, the frequency of single-nucleotide replacements is substantially elevated within 10 nucleotides from other replacements that occurred on the same lineage but not on another lineage. The data imply that dinucleotide replacements (DNRs) affecting sites at distances of up to 10 nucleotides from each other are responsible for 2.3\% of single-nucleotide replacements in primate genomes and for 5.6\% in Drosophila genomes. Among these DNRs, 26\% and 69\%, respectively, are in fact parts of replacements of three or more trinucleotide replacements (TNRs). The plurality of MNRs affect nearby nucleotides, so that at least six times as many DNRs affect two adjacent nucleotide sites than sites 10 nucleotides apart. Still, approximately 60\% of DNRs, and approximately 90\% of TNRs, span distances more than two (or three) nucleotides. MNRs make a major contribution to the observed clustering of substitutions: In the human-chimpanzee comparison, DNRs are responsible for 50\% of cases when two nearby replacements are observed on the human lineage, and TNRs are responsible for 83\% of cases when three replacements at three immediately adjacent sites are observed on the human lineage. The prevalence of MNRs matches that is observed in data on de novo mutations and is also observed in the regions with the lowest sequence conservation, suggesting that MNRs mainly have mutational origin; however, epistatic selection and/or gene conversion may also play a role.},

@article{duret2009biased,
  abstract = { Recombination is typically thought of as a symmetrical process resulting in large-scale reciprocal genetic exchanges between homologous chromosomes. Recombination events, however, are also accompanied by short-scale, unidirectional exchanges known as gene conversion in the neighborhood of the initiating double-strand break. A large body of evidence suggests that gene conversion is GC-biased in many eukaryotes, including mammals and human. AT/GC heterozygotes produce more GC- than AT-gametes, thus conferring a population advantage to GC-alleles in high-recombining regions. This apparently unimportant feature of our molecular machinery has major evolutionary consequences. Structurally, GC-biased gene conversion explains the spatial distribution of GC-content in mammalian genomesâthe so-called isochore structure. Functionally, GC-biased gene conversion promotes the segregation and fixation of deleterious AT â GC mutations, thus increasing our genomic mutation load. Here we review the recent evidence for a GC-biased gene conversion process in mammals, and its consequences for genomic landscapes, molecular evolution, and human functional genomics. },

  abstract = {Nucleotide substitution in both coding and noncoding regions is context-dependent, in the sense that substitution rates depend on the identity of neighboring bases. Context-dependent substitution has been modeled in the case of two sequences and an unrooted phylogenetic tree, but it has only been accommodated in limited ways with more general phylogenies. In this article, extensions are presented to standard phylogenetic models that allow for better handling of context-dependent substitution, yet still permit exact inference at reasonable computational cost. The new models improve goodness of fit substantially for both coding and noncoding data. Considering context dependence leads to much larger improvements than does using a richer substitution model or allowing for rate variation across sites, under the assumption of site independence. The observed improvements appear to derive from three separate properties of the models: their explicit characterization of context-dependent substitution within N-tuples of adjacent sites, their ability to accommodate overlapping N-tuples, and their rich parameterization of the substitution process. Parameter estimation is accomplished using an expectation maximization algorithm, with a quasi-Newton algorithm for the maximization step; this approach is shown to be preferable to ordinary Newton methods for parameter-rich models. Overlapping tuples are efficiently handled by assuming Markov dependence of the observed bases at each site on those at the N - 1 preceding sites, and the required conditional probabilities are computed with an extension of Felsenstein's algorithm. Estimated substitution rates based on a data set of about 160,000 noncoding sites in mammalian genomes indicate a pronounced CpG effect, but they also suggest a complex overall pattern of context-dependent substitution, comprising a variety of subtle effects. Estimates based on about 3 million sites in coding regions demonstrate that amino acid substitution rates can be learned at the nucleotide level, and suggest that context effects across codon boundaries are significant.},

@article{berard2012accurate,
  abstract = {Most models and algorithms developed to perform statistical inference from DNA data make the assumption that substitution processes affecting distinct nucleotide sites are stochastically independent. This assumption ensures both mathematical and computational tractability but is in disagreement with observed data in many situations--one well-known example being CpG dinucleotide hypermutability in mammalian genomes. In this paper, we consider the class of RN95 + YpR substitution models, which allows neighbor-dependent effects--including CpG hypermutability--to be taken into account, through transitions between pyrimidine-purine dinucleotides. We show that it is possible to adapt inference methods originally developed under the assumption of independence between sites to RN95 + YpR models, using a mathematically rigorous framework provided by specific structural properties of this class of models. We assess how efficient this approach is at inferring the CpG hypermutability rate from aligned DNA sequences. The method is tested on simulated data and compared against several alternatives; the results suggest that it delivers a high degree of accuracy at a low computational cost. We then apply our method to an alignment of 10 DNA sequences from primate species. Model comparisons within the RN95 + YpR class show the importance of taking into account neighbor-dependent effects. An application of the method to the detection of hypomethylated islands is discussed.},

The neighbor dependency makes the models analytically intractable, and previously Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have been used for statistical inference.

The pseudo-likelihood estimates are shown to be very accurate, and from analyzing 348 human-mouse coding sequences we conclude that the incorporation of a CpG effect improves the fit of the model considerably.

The model is irreversible, giving an arrow to time, and allowing the position of the root between a pair of sequences to be inferred without using out-groups.We applied the model upon aligned human-mouse non-coding data.

An analytic solution for this class of models is developed by adopting well-known methods of nonlinear dynamics. Results are presented for the CpG-methylation-deamination process, which dominates point substitutions in vertebrates. The dinucleotide frequencies generated by the model (using empirically obtained mutation rates) match the overall pattern observed in noncoding DNA. A web-based tool has been constructed to compute single- and dinucleotide frequencies for arbitrary neighbor-dependent mutation rates. Also provided is the backward procedure to infer the mutation rates using maximum likelihood analysis given the observed single- and dinucleotide frequencies. Reasonable estimates of the mutation rates can be obtained very efficiently, using generic noncoding DNA sequences as input, after masking out long homonucleotide subsequences. Our method is much more convenient and versatile to use than the traditional method of deducing mutation rates by counting mutation events in carefully chosen sequences. More generally, our approach provides a more realistic but still tractable description of noncoding genomic DNA and may be used as a null model for various sequence analysis applications.},

@misc{harris2013errorprone,
  abstract = {About 2\% of human genetic polymorphisms have been hypothesized to arise via
multinucleotide mutations (MNMs), complex events that generate SNPs at multiple
sites in a single generation. MNMs have the potential to accelerate the pace at
which single genes evolve and to confound studies of demography and selection
that assume all SNPs arise independently. In this paper, we examine clustered
mutations that are segregating in a set of 1,092 human genomes, demonstrating
that MNMs become enriched as large numbers of individuals are sampled. We
leverage the size of the dataset to deduce new information about the allelic
spectrum of MNMs, estimating the percentage of linked SNP pairs that were
generated by simultaneous mutation as a function of the distance between the
affected sites and showing that MNMs exhibit a high percentage of transversions
relative to transitions. These findings are reproducible in data from multiple
sequencing platforms. Among tandem mutations that occur simultaneously at
adjacent sites, we find an especially skewed distribution of ancestral and
derived dinucleotides, with $\textrm{GC}\to \textrm{AA}$, $\textrm{GA}\to
\textrm{TT}$ and their reverse complements making up 36\% of the total. These
same mutations dominate the spectrum of tandem mutations produced by the
upregulation of low-fidelity Polymerase $\zeta$ in mutator strains of S.
cerevisiae that have impaired DNA excision repair machinery. This suggests that
low-fidelity DNA replication by Pol $\zeta$ is at least partly responsible for
the MNMs that are segregating in the human population, and that useful
information about the biochemistry of MNM can be extracted from ordinary
population genomic data. We incorporate our findings into a mathematical model
of the multinucleotide mutation process that can be used to correct
phylogenetic and population genetic methods for the presence of MNMs.},

  abstract = { We present a model and methodology for the maximum likelihood analysis of pariwise alignments of DNA sequences in which two genes are encoded in overlapping reading frames. In the model for the substitution process, the instantaneous rates of substitution are allowed to depend upon the nucleotides occupying the sites in a neighborhood of the site subject to substitution, at the instant of the substitution. By defining the neighborhood of a site to extend over all sites in the codons in both reading frames to which a site belong, constraints imposed by the genetic code in both reading frames can be taken into account. Due to the dependency of the instantaneous rates of substitution on the states at neighboring sites, the transition probability between sequences does not factorize and therefore can not be obtained directly. We present a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure for obtaining the ratio of two transition probabilities between two sequences under the model considered, and describe how maximum likelihood parameter estimation and likelihood ration tests can be performed using the procedure. We describe how the expected numbers of different types of substitutions in the shared histroy of two sequences can be calculated and use the described model and methodology in an analysis of a pairwise alignment of two Hepatitis B sequences in which two genes are encoded in overlapping frames. Finally, we present an extended model together with a simpler approximate estimation procedure, and use this to test the adequacy of the former model. },

Given the inherent non-reversible nature of the well-known CpG-methylation-deamination process in mammalian evolution, non-reversible context-dependent evolutionary models may be well able to accurately model such a process. In particular, the lack of constraints on non-reversible substitution models might allow for more accurate estimation of context-dependent substitution parameters. To demonstrate this, we have developed different time-homogeneous context-dependent evolutionary models to analyze a large genomic dataset of primate ancestral repeats based on existing independent evolutionary models.

We find that non-reversible context-dependent models can drastically increase model fit when compared to independent models and this on two primate non-coding datasets.

@article{baele2010modelling,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Recent approaches for context-dependent evolutionary modelling assume that the evolution of a given site depends upon its ancestor and that ancestor's immediate flanking sites. Because such dependency pattern cannot be imposed on the root sequence, we consider the use of different orders of Markov chains to model dependence at the ancestral root sequence. Root distributions which are coupled to the context-dependent model across the underlying phylogenetic tree are deemed more realistic than decoupled Markov chains models, as the evolutionary process is responsible for shaping the composition of the ancestral root sequence.RESULTS:We find strong support, in terms of Bayes Factors, for using a second-order Markov chain at the ancestral root sequence along with a context-dependent model throughout the remainder of the phylogenetic tree in an ancestral repeats dataset, and for using a first-order Markov chain at the ancestral root sequence in a pseudogene dataset. Relaxing the assumption of a single context-independent set of independent model frequencies as presented in previous work, yields a further drastic increase in model fit. We show that the substitution rates associated with the CpG-methylation-deamination process can be modelled through context-dependent model frequencies and that their accuracy depends on the (order of the) Markov chain imposed at the ancestral root sequence. In addition, we provide evidence that this approach (which assumes that root distribution and evolutionary model are decoupled) outperforms an approach inspired by the work of Arndt et al., where the root distribution is coupled to the evolutionary model. We show that the continuous-time approximation of Hwang and Green has stronger support in terms of Bayes Factors, but the parameter estimates show minimal differences.CONCLUSIONS:We show that the combination of a dependency scheme at the ancestral root sequence and a context-dependent evolutionary model across the remainder of the tree allows for accurate estimation of the model's parameters. The different assumptions tested in this manuscript clearly show that designing accurate context-dependent models is a complex process, with many different assumptions that require validation. Further, these assumptions are shown to change across different datasets, making the search for an adequate model for a given dataset quite challenging.},

  abstract = {Analyses of serially-sampled data often begin with the assumption that the observations represent discrete samples from a latent continuous-time stochastic process. The continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) is one such generative model whose popularity extends to a variety of disciplines ranging from computational finance to human genetics and genomics. A common theme among these diverse applications is the need to simulate sample paths of a CTMC conditional on realized data that is discretely observed. Here we present a general solution to this sampling problem when the CTMC is defined on a discrete and finite state space. Specifically, we consider the generation of sample paths, including intermediate states and times of transition, from a CTMC whose beginning and ending states are known across a time interval of length T. We first unify the literature through a discussion of the three predominant approaches: (1) modified rejection sampling, (2) direct sampling, and (3) uniformization. We then give analytical results for the complexity and efficiency of each method in terms of the instantaneous transition rate matrix Q of the CTMC, its beginning and ending states, and the length of sampling time T. In doing so, we show that no method dominates the others across all model specifications, and we give explicit proof of which method prevails for any given Q, T, and endpoints. Finally, we introduce and compare three applications of CTMCs to demonstrate the pitfalls of choosing an inefficient sampler. },

  abstract = {A main assumption of molecular population genetics is that genomic mutation rate does not depend on sequence function. Challenging this assumption, a recent study has found a reduction in the mutation rate in exons compared to introns in somatic cells, ascribed to an enhanced exonic mismatch repair system activity. If this reduction happens also in the germline, it can compromise studies of population genomics, including the detection of selection when using introns as proxies for neutrality. Here we compile and analyze published germline de novo mutation data to test if the exonic mutation rate is also reduced in germ cells. After controlling for sampling bias in datasets with diseased probands and extended nucleotide context dependency, we find no reduction in the mutation rate in exons compared to introns in the germline. Therefore, there is no evidence that enhanced exonic mismatch repair activity determines the mutation rate in germline cells.},

@article{gao2019overlooked,
  abstract = {More than three-fourths of human germline mutations are paternal in origin and their total number increases with the father{\textquoteright}s age at conception. These observations are thought to support the textbook view that germline point mutations stem mostly from DNA replication errors. Analyzing large germline mutation datasets for humans, we find that this understanding cannot explain the observed patterns of new mutations. Instead, we show that the male mutation bias is not driven by spermatogenesis. We further find evidence that a substantial fraction of mutations are not replicative in origin and uncover a potential effect of a mother{\textquoteright}s age on the number of mutations that happen early in the development of the embryo.The textbook view that most germline mutations in mammals arise from replication errors is indirectly supported by the fact that there are both more mutations and more cell divisions in the male than in the female germline. When analyzing large de novo mutation datasets in humans, we find multiple lines of evidence that call that view into question. Notably, despite the drastic increase in the ratio of male to female germ cell divisions after the onset of spermatogenesis, even young fathers contribute three times more mutations than young mothers, and this ratio barely increases with parental age. This surprising finding points to a substantial contribution of damage-induced mutations. Indeed, C-to-G transversions and CpG transitions, which together constitute over one-fourth of all base substitution mutations, show genomic distributions and sex-specific age dependencies indicative of double-strand break repair and methylation-associated damage, respectively. Moreover, we find evidence that maternal age at conception influences the mutation rate both because of the accumulation of damage in oocytes and potentially through an influence on the number of postzygotic mutations in the embryo. These findings reveal underappreciated roles of DNA damage and maternal age in the genesis of human germline mutations.},

@article{herediagenestar2020extreme,
  abstract = {Mutations do not accumulate uniformly across the genome. Human germline and tumor mutation density correlate poorly, and each is associated with different genomic features. Here, we use non-human great ape (NHGA) germlines to determine human germline- and tumor-specific deviations from an ancestral-like great ape genome-wide mutational landscape. Strikingly, we find that the distribution of mutation densities in tumors presents a stronger correlation with NHGA than with human germlines. This effect is driven by human-specific differences in the distribution of mutations at non-CpG sites. We propose that ancestral human demographic events, together with the human-specific mutation slowdown, disrupted the human genome-wide distribution of mutation densities. Tumors partially recover this distribution by accumulating preneoplastic-like somatic mutations. Our results highlight the potential utility of using NHGA population data, rather than human controls, to establish the expected mutational background of healthy somatic cells.},

    abstract = { Population histories are encoded by genomic variation among modern individuals. Population genetic inference methods, all theoretically rooted in probabilistic population models, can recover complex demographic histories from genomic variation data. However, the mutation process is treated very simply in these modelsâusually as a single constant. Recent empirical findings show that the mutation process is complex and dynamic over a range of evolutionary timescales and thus, deserving of richer descriptions in population genetic models. Here, we show that complex mutation spectrum histories can be accommodated by extending classical theoretical tools. We develop mathematical optimization methods and software to infer both demographic history and mutation spectrum history, revealing human mutation signatures varying through time and global divergence of mutational processes. As populations boom and bust, the accumulation of genetic diversity is modulated, encoding histories of living populations in present-day variation. Many methods exist to decode these histories, and all must make strong model assumptions. It is typical to assume that mutations accumulate uniformly across the genome at a constant rate that does not vary between closely related populations. However, recent work shows that mutational processes in human and great ape populations vary across genomic regions and evolve over time. This perturbs the mutation spectrum (relative mutation rates in different local nucleotide contexts). Here, we develop theoretical tools in the framework of Kingmanâs coalescent to accommodate mutation spectrum dynamics. We present mutation spectrum history inference (mushi), a method to perform nonparametric inference of demographic and mutation spectrum histories from allele frequency data. We use mushi to reconstruct trajectories of effective population size and mutation spectrum divergence between human populations, identify mutation signatures and their dynamics in different human populations, and calibrate the timing of a previously reported mutational pulse in the ancestors of Europeans. We show that mutation spectrum histories can be placed in a well-studied theoretical setting and rigorously inferred from genomic variation data, like other features of evolutionary history. }
