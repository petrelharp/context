  abstract = {Hidden Markov random fields represent a complex hierarchical model, where the
hidden latent process is an undirected graphical structure. Performing inference for
such models is difficult primarily because the likelihood of the hidden states is often
unavailable. The main contribution of this article is to present approximate methods
to calculate the likelihood for large lattices based on exact methods for smaller lat-
tices. We introduce approximate likelihood methods by relaxing some of the dependen-
cies in the latent model, and also by extending tractable approximations to the likeli-
hood, the so-called pseudolikelihood approximations, for a large lattice partitioned into
smaller sublattices. Results are presented based on simulated data as well as inference
for the temporal-spatial structure of the interaction between up- and down-regulated
states within the mitochondrial chromosome of the Plasmodium falciparum organism.

However they are complicated to work with due to an intractability of the likelihood function. It is therefore natural to consider tractable approximations to the likelihood function. Composite likelihoods offer a principled approach to constructing such approximation.

@article{besag1986statistical,
  abstract = {A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or
"pixels", each pixel having a particular "colour" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The
true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly
multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a
known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional
knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper,
it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a non-
degenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by
Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However,
the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable large-
scale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is
proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is
illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the
assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed.
Potential applications are mentioned briefly.},

  abstract = {The individual spins of the Ising model are assumed to interact with an external agency (e.g., a heat
reservoir) which causes them to change their states randomly with time. Coupling between the spins
is introduced through the assumption that the transition probabilities for anyone spin depend on
the values of the neighboring spins. This dependence is determined, in part, by the detailed balancing
condItion obeyed by the equihbnum state of the model. The Markoff process which describes the
spin functions is analyzed in detail for the case of a closed N-member chain. The expectation values
of the individual spins and of the products of pairs of spins, each of the pair evaluated at a different
are found explicitly. The influence of a uniform, time-varying magnetic field upon the model
IS dIscussed, and the frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility is found in the weak-field limit.
Some fluctuation-dissipation theorems are derived which relate the susceptibility to the Fourier
transform of the time-dependent correlation function of the magnetization at equilibrium.},

@article{besag1972nearestneighbour,
  abstract = {Bartlett (1966) and Whittle (1963), respectively, have proposed alternative, non-equivalent definitions of nearest-neighbour systems. The former, conditional probability definition, whilst the more intuitively attractive, presents several basic problems, not least in the identification of available models. In this paper, conditional probability nearest-neighbour systems for interacting random variables on a two-dimensional rectangular lattice are examined. It is shown that, in the case of 0, 1 variables and a homogeneous system, the only possibility is a logistic-type model but in which the explanatory variables at a point are the surrounding array variables themselves. A spatial-temporal approach leading to the same model is also suggested. The final section deals with linear nearest-neighbour systems, especially for continuous variables. The results of the paper may easily be extended to three or more dimensions.},

Particular emphasis is placed upon practical applications of the models in plant ecology when the variates are binary or Gaussian. Some aspects of infinite lattice Gaussian processes are discussed. Methods of statistical analysis for lattice schemes are proposed, including a very flexible coding technique. The methods are illustrated by two numerical examples.

@article{geman1984stochastic,
  abstract = {We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

@article{pickard1982inference,
  abstract = {In previous papers (1976), (1977a), (1979) limit theorems were obtained for the classical Ising model, and these provided the basis for asymptotic inference. The present paper extends these results to more general Ising models. In two and more dimensions, likelihood inference for the thermodynamic parameters (i.e. the interaction energies) is effectively impossible. The problem is that the error in locating critical and/or confidence regions is as large as their diameters. To remedy this requires more accurate characterizations of the partition functions, but these seem unlikely to be forthcoming. Besag's coding estimators for these parameters are inverse hyperbolic tangents of the roots of simultaneous polynomial equations and hence avoid such location errors. However, little is yet known about their sampling characteristics. Finally, likelihood inference for lattice averages (an alternative parametrization) is straightforward from the limit theorems.},
