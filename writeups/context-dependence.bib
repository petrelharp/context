  abstract = {We develop an approximate maximum likelihood method to estimate flanking nucleotide context-dependent mutation rates and amino acid exchange-dependent selection in orthologous protein-coding sequences and use it to analyze genome-wide coding sequence alignments from mammals and yeast. Allowing context-dependent mutation provides a better fit to coding sequence data than simpler (context-independent or CpG "hotspot") models and significantly affects selection parameter estimates. Allowing asymmetric (nonreciprocal) selection on amino acid exchanges gives a better fit than simple dN/dS or symmetric selection models. Relative selection strength estimates from our models show good agreement with independent estimates derived from human disease-causing and engineered mutations. Selection strengths depend on local protein structure, showing expected biophysical trends in helical versus nonhelical regions and increased asymmetry on polar-hydrophobic exchanges with increased burial. The more stringent selection that has previously been observed for highly expressed proteins is primarily concentrated in buried regions, supporting the notion that such proteins are under stronger than average selection for stability. Our analyses indicate that a highly parameterized model of mutation and selection is computationally tractable and is a useful tool for exploring a variety of biological questions concerning protein and coding sequence evolution.},

  abstract = {Hidden Markov random fields represent a complex hierarchical model, where the
hidden latent process is an undirected graphical structure. Performing inference for
such models is difficult primarily because the likelihood of the hidden states is often
unavailable. The main contribution of this article is to present approximate methods
to calculate the likelihood for large lattices based on exact methods for smaller lat-
tices. We introduce approximate likelihood methods by relaxing some of the dependen-
cies in the latent model, and also by extending tractable approximations to the likeli-
hood, the so-called pseudolikelihood approximations, for a large lattice partitioned into
smaller sublattices. Results are presented based on simulated data as well as inference
for the temporal-spatial structure of the interaction between up- and down-regulated
states within the mitochondrial chromosome of the Plasmodium falciparum organism.

@article{besag1986statistical,
  abstract = {A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or
"pixels", each pixel having a particular "colour" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The
true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly
multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a
known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional
knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper,
it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a non-
degenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by
Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However,
the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable large-
scale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is
proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is
illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the
assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed.
Potential applications are mentioned briefly.},

reservoir) which causes them to change their states randomly with time. Coupling between the spins

the values of the neighboring spins. This dependence is determined, in part, by the detailed balancing
condItion obeyed by the equihbnum state of the model. The Markoff process which describes the
spin functions is analyzed in detail for the case of a closed N-member chain. The expectation values
of the individual spins and of the products of pairs of spins, each of the pair evaluated at a different

Some fluctuation-dissipation theorems are derived which relate the susceptibility to the Fourier

The former, conditional probability definition, whilst the more intuitively attractive, presents several basic problems, not least in the identification of available models. In this paper, conditional probability nearest-neighbour systems for interacting random variables on a two-dimensional rectangular lattice are examined. It is shown that, in the case of 0, 1 variables and a homogeneous system, the only possibility is a logistic-type model but in which the explanatory variables at a point are the surrounding array variables themselves. A spatial-temporal approach leading to the same model is also suggested. The final section deals with linear nearest-neighbour systems, especially for continuous variables. The results of the paper may easily be extended to three or more dimensions.},

@article{geman1984stochastic,
  abstract = {We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

@article{pickard1982inference,
  abstract = {In previous papers (1976), (1977a), (1979) limit theorems were obtained for the classical Ising model, and these provided the basis for asymptotic inference. The present paper extends these results to more general Ising models. In two and more dimensions, likelihood inference for the thermodynamic parameters (i.e. the interaction energies) is effectively impossible. The problem is that the error in locating critical and/or confidence regions is as large as their diameters. To remedy this requires more accurate characterizations of the partition functions, but these seem unlikely to be forthcoming. Besag's coding estimators for these parameters are inverse hyperbolic tangents of the roots of simultaneous polynomial equations and hence avoid such location errors. However, little is yet known about their sampling characteristics. Finally, likelihood inference for lattice averages (an alternative parametrization) is straightforward from the limit theorems.},

powerful tool for urban growth simulation, the calibration of CA had been largely
heuristic until recent e V orts to incorporate multi-criteria evaluation and arti cial
neural network into rule de nition. This study developed a stochastic CA model,
which derives its initial probability of simulation from observed sequential land
use data. Furthermore, this initial probability is updated dynamically through
local rules based on the strength of neighbourhood development. Consequentially
the integration of global (static) and local (dynamic) factors produces more realistic
simulation results. The procedure of calibrated CA can be applied in other
contexts with minimum modi cation. In this study we applied the procedure to
simulate rural-urban land conversions in the city of Guangzhou, China. Moreover,
the study suggests the need to examine the result of CA through spatial, tabular
and structural validation.},

  abstract = {Strand-symmetric relative abundance functionals for di-, tri-, and tetranucleotides are introduced and applied to sequences encompassing a broad phylogenetic range to discern tendencies and anomalies in the occurrences of these short oligonucleotides within and between genomic sequences. For dinucleotides, TA is almost universally under-represented, with the exception of vertebrate mitochondrial genomes, and CG is strongly under-represented in vertebrates and in mitochondrial genomes. The traditional methylation/deamination/mutation hypothesis for the rarity of CG does not adequately account for the observed deficiencies in certain sequences, notably the mitochondrial genomes, yeast, and Neurospora crassa, which lack the standard CpG methylase. Homodinucleotides (AA.TT, CC.GG) and larger homooligonucleotides are over-represented in many organisms, perhaps due to polymerase slippage events. For trinucleotides, GCA.TGC tends to be under-represented in phage, human viral, and eukaryotic sequences, and CTA.TAG is strongly under-represented in many prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and viral sequences. The CCA.TGG triplet is ubiquitously over-represented in human viral and eukaryotic sequences. Among the tetranucleotides, several four-base-pair palindromes tend to be under-represented in phage sequences, probably as a means of restriction avoidance. The tetranucleotide CTAG is observed to be rare in virtually all bacterial genomes and some phage genomes. Explanations for these over- and under-representations in terms of DNA/RNA structures and regulatory mechanisms are considered.},

@article{yaari2013models,
  abstract = {Analyses of somatic hypermutation (SHM) patterns in B cell immunoglobulin (Ig) sequences contribute to our basic understanding of adaptive immunity, and have broad applications not only for understanding the immune response to pathogens, but also to determining the role of SHM in autoimmunity and B cell cancers. Although stochastic, SHM displays intrinsic biases that can confound statistical analysis, especially when combined with the particular codon usage and base composition in Ig sequences. Analysis of B cell clonal expansion, diversification, and selection processes thus critically depends on an accurate background model for SHM micro-sequence targeting (i.e., hot/cold-spots) and nucleotide substitution. Existing models are based on small numbers of sequences/mutations, in part because they depend on data from non-coding regions or non-functional sequences to remove the confounding influences of selection. Here, we combine high-throughput Ig sequencing with new computational analysis methods to produce improved models of SHM targeting and substitution that are based only on synonymous mutations, and are thus independent of selection. The resulting “S5F” models are based on 806,860 Synonymous mutations in 5-mer motifs from 1,145,182 Functional sequences and account for dependencies on the adjacent four nucleotides (two bases upstream and downstream of the mutation). The estimated profiles can explain almost half of the variance in observed mutation patterns, and clearly show that both mutation targeting and substitution are significantly influenced by neighboring bases. While mutability and substitution profiles were highly conserved across individuals, the variability across motifs was found to be much larger than previously estimated.

The importance of having the rate at which a point mutation occurs depend on the DNA sequence at sites surrounding the mutation is now better appreciated and can be accommodated in probabilistic models of protein evolution. To quantify the evolutionary impact of some aspect of phenotype, one promising strategy is to develop a system for predicting phenotype from the DNA sequence and to then infer how the evolutionary rates of sequence change are affected by the predicted phenotypic consequences of the changes. Although statistical tools for characterizing protein evolution are improving, the list of candidate phenomena that can affect rates of protein evolution is long and the relative contributions of these phenomena are only beginning to be disentangled. },

@article{schaibley2013influence,
  abstract = {Understanding patterns of spontaneous mutations is of fundamental interest in studies of human genome evolution and genetic disease. Here, we used extremely rare variants in humans to model the molecular spectrum of single-nucleotide mutations. Compared to common variants in humans and human-chimpanzee fixed differences (substitutions), rare variants, on average, arose more recently in the human lineage and are less affected by the potentially confounding effects of natural selection, population demographic history, and biased gene conversion. We analyzed variants obtained from a population-based sequencing study of 202 genes in >14,000 individuals. We observed considerable variability in the per-gene mutation rate, which was correlated with local GC content, but not recombination rate. Using >20,000 variants with a derived allele frequency ≤10(-4), we examined the effect of local GC content and recombination rate on individual variant subtypes and performed comparisons with common variants and substitutions. The influence of local GC content on rare variants differed from that on common variants or substitutions, and the differences varied by variant subtype. Furthermore, recombination rate and recombination hotspots have little effect on rare variants of any subtype, yet both have a relatively strong impact on multiple variant subtypes in common variants and substitutions. This observation is consistent with the effect of biased gene conversion or selection-dependent processes. Our results highlight the distinct biases inherent in the initial mutation patterns and subsequent evolutionary processes that affect segregating variants.},

@article{schrider2011pervasive,

However, it is still often assumed that single-nucleotide mutations are independent of one another, each being caused by separate mutational events. The occurrence of multiple, closely spaced substitutions appears to violate assumptions of independence and is often interpreted as evidence for the action of adaptive natural selection [2, 3], balancing selection [4], or compensatory evolution [5, 6]. Here we provide evidence of a frequent, widespread multinucleotide mutational process active throughout eukaryotes. Genomic data from mutation-accumulation experiments, parent-offspring trios, and human polymorphisms all show that simultaneous nucleotide substitutions occur within short stretches of DNA. Regardless of species, such multinucleotide mutations (MNMs) consistently comprise \~3% of the total number of nucleotide substitutions. These results imply that previous adaptive interpretations of multiple, closely spaced substitutions may have been unwarranted and that MNMs must be considered when interpreting sequence data.},

@article{terekhanova2013prevalence,
  abstract = {Evolution of sequences mostly involves independent changes at different sites. However, substitutions at neighboring sites may co-occur as multinucleotide replacement events (MNRs). Here, we compare noncoding sequences of several species of primates, and of three species of Drosophila fruit flies, in a phylogenetic analysis of the replacements that occurred between species at nearby nucleotide sites. Both in primates and in Drosophila, the frequency of single-nucleotide replacements is substantially elevated within 10 nucleotides from other replacements that occurred on the same lineage but not on another lineage. The data imply that dinucleotide replacements (DNRs) affecting sites at distances of up to 10 nucleotides from each other are responsible for 2.3\% of single-nucleotide replacements in primate genomes and for 5.6\% in Drosophila genomes. Among these DNRs, 26\% and 69\%, respectively, are in fact parts of replacements of three or more trinucleotide replacements (TNRs). The plurality of MNRs affect nearby nucleotides, so that at least six times as many DNRs affect two adjacent nucleotide sites than sites 10 nucleotides apart. Still, approximately 60\% of DNRs, and approximately 90\% of TNRs, span distances more than two (or three) nucleotides. MNRs make a major contribution to the observed clustering of substitutions: In the human-chimpanzee comparison, DNRs are responsible for 50\% of cases when two nearby replacements are observed on the human lineage, and TNRs are responsible for 83\% of cases when three replacements at three immediately adjacent sites are observed on the human lineage. The prevalence of MNRs matches that is observed in data on de novo mutations and is also observed in the regions with the lowest sequence conservation, suggesting that MNRs mainly have mutational origin; however, epistatic selection and/or gene conversion may also play a role.},

@article{duret2009biased,
  abstract = { Recombination is typically thought of as a symmetrical process resulting in large-scale reciprocal genetic exchanges between homologous chromosomes. Recombination events, however, are also accompanied by short-scale, unidirectional exchanges known as gene conversion in the neighborhood of the initiating double-strand break. A large body of evidence suggests that gene conversion is GC-biased in many eukaryotes, including mammals and human. AT/GC heterozygotes produce more GC- than AT-gametes, thus conferring a population advantage to GC-alleles in high-recombining regions. This apparently unimportant feature of our molecular machinery has major evolutionary consequences. Structurally, GC-biased gene conversion explains the spatial distribution of GC-content in mammalian genomes—the so-called isochore structure. Functionally, GC-biased gene conversion promotes the segregation and fixation of deleterious AT → GC mutations, thus increasing our genomic mutation load. Here we review the recent evidence for a GC-biased gene conversion process in mammals, and its consequences for genomic landscapes, molecular evolution, and human functional genomics. },

@article{siepel2004phylogenetic,
  abstract = {Nucleotide substitution in both coding and noncoding regions is context-dependent, in the sense that substitution rates depend on the identity of neighboring bases. Context-dependent substitution has been modeled in the case of two sequences and an unrooted phylogenetic tree, but it has only been accommodated in limited ways with more general phylogenies. In this article, extensions are presented to standard phylogenetic models that allow for better handling of context-dependent substitution, yet still permit exact inference at reasonable computational cost. The new models improve goodness of fit substantially for both coding and noncoding data. Considering context dependence leads to much larger improvements than does using a richer substitution model or allowing for rate variation across sites, under the assumption of site independence. The observed improvements appear to derive from three separate properties of the models: their explicit characterization of context-dependent substitution within N-tuples of adjacent sites, their ability to accommodate overlapping N-tuples, and their rich parameterization of the substitution process. Parameter estimation is accomplished using an expectation maximization algorithm, with a quasi-Newton algorithm for the maximization step; this approach is shown to be preferable to ordinary Newton methods for parameter-rich models. Overlapping tuples are efficiently handled by assuming Markov dependence of the observed bases at each site on those at the N - 1 preceding sites, and the required conditional probabilities are computed with an extension of Felsenstein's algorithm. Estimated substitution rates based on a data set of about 160,000 noncoding sites in mammalian genomes indicate a pronounced CpG effect, but they also suggest a complex overall pattern of context-dependent substitution, comprising a variety of subtle effects. Estimates based on about 3 million sites in coding regions demonstrate that amino acid substitution rates can be learned at the nucleotide level, and suggest that context effects across codon boundaries are significant.},

@article{berard2012accurate,
  abstract = {Most models and algorithms developed to perform statistical inference from DNA data make the assumption that substitution processes affecting distinct nucleotide sites are stochastically independent. This assumption ensures both mathematical and computational tractability but is in disagreement with observed data in many situations--one well-known example being CpG dinucleotide hypermutability in mammalian genomes. In this paper, we consider the class of RN95 + YpR substitution models, which allows neighbor-dependent effects--including CpG hypermutability--to be taken into account, through transitions between pyrimidine-purine dinucleotides. We show that it is possible to adapt inference methods originally developed under the assumption of independence between sites to RN95 + YpR models, using a mathematically rigorous framework provided by specific structural properties of this class of models. We assess how efficient this approach is at inferring the CpG hypermutability rate from aligned DNA sequences. The method is tested on simulated data and compared against several alternatives; the results suggest that it delivers a high degree of accuracy at a low computational cost. We then apply our method to an alignment of 10 DNA sequences from primate species. Model comparisons within the RN95 + YpR class show the importance of taking into account neighbor-dependent effects. An application of the method to the detection of hypomethylated islands is discussed.},

@article{christensen2005pseudolikelihood,
  abstract = {Recently, Markov processes for the evolution of coding DNA with neighbor dependence in the instantaneous substitution rates have been considered. The neighbor dependency makes the models analytically intractable, and previously Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have been used for statistical inference. Using a pseudo-likelihood idea, we introduce in this paper an approximative estimation method which is fast to compute. The pseudo-likelihood estimates are shown to be very accurate, and from analyzing 348 human-mouse coding sequences we conclude that the incorporation of a CpG effect improves the fit of the model considerably.
(PLR: The pseudolikelihood uses the probability that a given codon changes from x to y with the neighboring two nucleotides either fixed or undergoing a single transition halfway down the branch.)},

@article{lunter2004nucleotide,
  abstract = {It is well known that neighbouring nucleotides in DNA sequences do not mutate independently of each other. In this paper, we introduce a context-dependent substitution model and derive an algorithm to calculate the likelihood of sequences evolving under this model. We use this algorithm to estimate neighbour-dependent substitution rates, as well as rates for dinucleotide substitutions, using a Bayesian sampling procedure. The model is irreversible, giving an arrow to time, and allowing the position of the root between a pair of sequences to be inferred without using out-groups.We applied the model upon aligned human-mouse non-coding data. Clear neighbour dependencies were observed, including 17-18-fold increased CpG to TpG/CpA rates compared with other substitutions. Root inference positioned the root halfway the mouse and human tips, suggesting an approximately clock-like behaviour of the irreversible part of the substitution process.},

Markov processes on a phylogenetic tree. We consider neighbor-dependent evolution-
ary models where the instantaneous rate of substitution at a site depends on the states
of the neighboring sites. Neighbor-dependent substitution models are analytically in-
tractable and must be analyzed using either approximate or simulation-based methods.
We describe statistical inference of neighbor-dependent models using a Markov chain
Monte Carlo expectation maximization (MCMC-EM) algorithm. In the MCMC-EM
algorithm, the high-dimensional integrals required in the EM algorithm are estimated
using MCMC sampling. The MCMC sampler requires simulation of sample paths from
a continuous time Markov process, conditional on the beginning and ending states and
the paths of the neighboring sites. An exact path sampling algorithm is developed for
this purpose.

@article{arndt2003sequence,
  abstract = {We introduce a model of DNA sequence evolution which can account for biases in mutation rates that depend on the identity of the neighboring bases. An analytic solution for this class of models is developed by adopting well-known methods of nonlinear dynamics. Results are presented for the CpG-methylation-deamination process, which dominates point substitutions in vertebrates. The dinucleotide frequencies generated by the model (using empirically obtained mutation rates) match the overall pattern observed in noncoding DNA. A web-based tool has been constructed to compute single- and dinucleotide frequencies for arbitrary neighbor-dependent mutation rates. Also provided is the backward procedure to infer the mutation rates using maximum likelihood analysis given the observed single- and dinucleotide frequencies. Reasonable estimates of the mutation rates can be obtained very efficiently, using generic noncoding DNA sequences as input, after masking out long homonucleotide subsequences. Our method is much more convenient and versatile to use than the traditional method of deducing mutation rates by counting mutation events in carefully chosen sequences. More generally, our approach provides a more realistic but still tractable description of noncoding genomic DNA and may be used as a null model for various sequence analysis applications.},

@misc{harris2013errorprone,
  abstract = {About 2\% of human genetic polymorphisms have been hypothesized to arise via
multinucleotide mutations (MNMs), complex events that generate SNPs at multiple
sites in a single generation. MNMs have the potential to accelerate the pace at
which single genes evolve and to confound studies of demography and selection
that assume all SNPs arise independently. In this paper, we examine clustered
mutations that are segregating in a set of 1,092 human genomes, demonstrating
that MNMs become enriched as large numbers of individuals are sampled. We
leverage the size of the dataset to deduce new information about the allelic
spectrum of MNMs, estimating the percentage of linked SNP pairs that were
generated by simultaneous mutation as a function of the distance between the
affected sites and showing that MNMs exhibit a high percentage of transversions
relative to transitions. These findings are reproducible in data from multiple
sequencing platforms. Among tandem mutations that occur simultaneously at
adjacent sites, we find an especially skewed distribution of ancestral and
derived dinucleotides, with $\textrm{GC}\to \textrm{AA}$, $\textrm{GA}\to
\textrm{TT}$ and their reverse complements making up 36% of the total. These
same mutations dominate the spectrum of tandem mutations produced by the
upregulation of low-fidelity Polymerase $\zeta$ in mutator strains of S.
cerevisiae that have impaired DNA excision repair machinery. This suggests that
low-fidelity DNA replication by Pol $\zeta$ is at least partly responsible for
the MNMs that are segregating in the human population, and that useful
information about the biochemistry of MNM can be extracted from ordinary
population genomic data. We incorporate our findings into a mathematical model
of the multinucleotide mutation process that can be used to correct
phylogenetic and population genetic methods for the presence of MNMs.},

@misc{pedersen2000dependent,
  abstract = { We present a model and methodology for the maximum likelihood analysis of pariwise alignments of DNA sequences in which two genes are encoded in overlapping reading frames. In the model for the substitution process, the instantaneous rates of substitution are allowed to depend upon the nucleotides occupying the sites in a neighborhood of the site subject to substitution, at the instant of the substitution. By defining the neighborhood of a site to extend over all sites in the codons in both reading frames to which a site belong, constraints imposed by the genetic code in both reading frames can be taken into account. Due to the dependency of the instantaneous rates of substitution on the states at neighboring sites, the transition probability between sequences does not factorize and therefore can not be obtained directly. We present a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure for obtaining the ratio of two transition probabilities between two sequences under the model considered, and describe how maximum likelihood parameter estimation and likelihood ration tests can be performed using the procedure. We describe how the expected numbers of different types of substitutions in the shared histroy of two sequences can be calculated and use the described model and methodology in an analysis of a pairwise alignment of two Hepatitis B sequences in which two genes are encoded in overlapping frames. Finally, we present an extended model together with a simpler approximate estimation procedure, and use this to test the adequacy of the former model. },

  abstract = {We discuss the importance of non-reversible evolutionary models when analyzing context-dependence. Given the inherent non-reversible nature of the well-known CpG-methylation-deamination process in mammalian evolution, non-reversible context-dependent evolutionary models may be well able to accurately model such a process. In particular, the lack of constraints on non-reversible substitution models might allow for more accurate estimation of context-dependent substitution parameters. To demonstrate this, we have developed different time-homogeneous context-dependent evolutionary models to analyze a large genomic dataset of primate ancestral repeats based on existing independent evolutionary models. We have calculated the difference in model fit for each of these models using Bayes Factors obtained via thermodynamic integration. We find that non-reversible context-dependent models can drastically increase model fit when compared to independent models and this on two primate non-coding datasets. Further, we show that further improvements are possible by clustering similar parameters across contexts.},

@article{baele2010modelling,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Recent approaches for context-dependent evolutionary modelling assume that the evolution of a given site depends upon its ancestor and that ancestor's immediate flanking sites. Because such dependency pattern cannot be imposed on the root sequence, we consider the use of different orders of Markov chains to model dependence at the ancestral root sequence. Root distributions which are coupled to the context-dependent model across the underlying phylogenetic tree are deemed more realistic than decoupled Markov chains models, as the evolutionary process is responsible for shaping the composition of the ancestral root sequence.RESULTS:We find strong support, in terms of Bayes Factors, for using a second-order Markov chain at the ancestral root sequence along with a context-dependent model throughout the remainder of the phylogenetic tree in an ancestral repeats dataset, and for using a first-order Markov chain at the ancestral root sequence in a pseudogene dataset. Relaxing the assumption of a single context-independent set of independent model frequencies as presented in previous work, yields a further drastic increase in model fit. We show that the substitution rates associated with the CpG-methylation-deamination process can be modelled through context-dependent model frequencies and that their accuracy depends on the (order of the) Markov chain imposed at the ancestral root sequence. In addition, we provide evidence that this approach (which assumes that root distribution and evolutionary model are decoupled) outperforms an approach inspired by the work of Arndt et al., where the root distribution is coupled to the evolutionary model. We show that the continuous-time approximation of Hwang and Green has stronger support in terms of Bayes Factors, but the parameter estimates show minimal differences.CONCLUSIONS:We show that the combination of a dependency scheme at the ancestral root sequence and a context-dependent evolutionary model across the remainder of the tree allows for accurate estimation of the model's parameters. The different assumptions tested in this manuscript clearly show that designing accurate context-dependent models is a complex process, with many different assumptions that require validation. Further, these assumptions are shown to change across different datasets, making the search for an adequate model for a given dataset quite challenging.},
