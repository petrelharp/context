We observe alleles that are polymorphic in humans (left branch),
and the same allele observed in one chimp (middle) and one gorilla (right).
Depicted are the four most parsimonious scenarios: 
in any case it requires one mutation;
and in other cases it requires at least two more rare(-ish) events:
incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and/or another mutation.
The likelihoods are, I think:
\begin{align}
  p_A > p_B > p_C > p_D ,
\end{align}
(see below); but $D$ will create the bump on the right.

\begin{enumerate}

\item[A] The standard model, mutation sometime in the tree leading to modern humans.
Frequency distribution skewed towards low frequency.

\item[B] Two mutations, one leading to chimps and humans; the other on the gorilla lineage.  Requires the polymorphism in humans to be fairly old, so has a flat frequency distribution.

\item[C] One mutation, but long ago.  Requires the polymorphism to be old, again.

\item[D] Two mutations, one in chimp-gorilla and one in humans.  The red allele, being recently derived, has a skew towards low frequencies; which we miscall as high derived frequencies.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Asymmetric mutation}

Suppose possibly asymmetric mutation rates: $\muup$ from black to red,
and $\mudn$ from red to black.
Suppose that the probability of ILS in the whole human lineage is $\eta_C$,
and in the human-chimp ancestor is $\eta_G$.
Finally, suppose that the typical coalscence times in human, human-chip ancestor, and human-chimp-gorilla ancestor are, respectively, $T_H$, $T_C$, and $T_G$.
The the relative rates of $A$--$D$ are, roughly:
\begin{align}
A&: \mudn T_H & B&: \muup^2 T_C T_G \eta_C \\
C&: \muup T_G \eta_C \eta_G & D&: \muup^2 T_H T_G \eta_G  .
\end{align}

The human-chimp divergence is like 7 mya, 
and the human-chimp-gorilla only a couple more million years back;
and ancestral effective population sizes are thought to have been $\sim 10 \times$ larger than the human effective population size; so $\eta_G$ is not so small at all: 
like, 0.2?
On the other hand, we have lots of samples, so the chance of more than one lineage making it back to the human-chimp ancestor is pretty good, maybe of similar order?
If $\muup/\mudn \approx 10$, this suggests that the ratio of $A$ to $C$ is about 10:1.

In $C$ and $D$ the relevant numbers of generations for mutation should be around $10^5$; for $T_H$ in $D$ this is thanks to the large number of samples; 
and for $T_G$ in both this is thanks to the large effective population size of the ancestral population.  
Even if $\muup \approx 10^{-7}$, this still leaves $D$ about 1000 times less likely than $A$.

As for $B$, note that the mutation on gorilla has the full branch to occur on, i.e.~$\sim10^7$ years; so $\muup T_G$ is only a small factor.
Because there are fewer lineages to mutate, the mutation in human-chimp is less likely than the one occurring in $A$ by ad additional factor; and the incomplete lineage sorting is another factor. 
Incorporating $\muup/\mudn\approx10$, this suggest a $A:D$ ratio of only about 10:1.

\section{Selection}

Selection (or biased gene conversion) will do several things:
effectively increase the mutation rate of the beneficial allele;
make ILS \emph{less} likely;
and distort the frequency spectrum.

\ldots effects on $A$--$D$?
