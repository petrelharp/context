These coordinates are based on genome build mm9 (also known as NCBI37).


chr X:
25 regions
mean_recombination=0.8481 cM/Mb
median_recombination=0.8090
stdev_recombination=0.0550
mean_bp_per_region=90897.8000
total_bp=2272445

autosomes:
480 regions
mean_recombination=0.9714
median_recombination=0.9500
stdev_recombination=0.1297
mean_bp_per_region=99898.2208
total_bp=47951146

As you can see, there are 47.95 MB of autosomal bp to choose from, plus 2.27 MB of chrX.  We had talked about enriching a total target size of 1MB, so that gives you plenty to choose from based on mappability, etc.

Basically, I'd like half the target to come from chrX and the other half to come from any autosomal regions.

Just so you know, these are regions that are at least 200kb from any protein coding gene.


Each region is at least 500 kb long and at least 200 kb away from a gene.  To maintain consistency, I would only consider regions that are at least 200 kb away from each other as independent markers (roughly about the extent of LD in wild domesticus at least).  

These regions have been filtered to be present in spretus (from Keane et al.).  In other words, I didn't enrich a region unless I knew it was there in spretus.  The reason some regions are close is because those are gaps in their genome build.  

... and the spretus genome came from this: Keane, T.M., Goodstadt, L., Danecek, P., White, M.A., Wong, K., Yalcin, B., Heger, A., Agam, A., Slater, G., Goodson, M., et al. (2011). Mouse genomic variation and its effect on phenotypes and gene regulation. Nature 477, 289-294.

(it was mapped to NCBI37).
