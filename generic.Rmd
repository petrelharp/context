# Results from fitting procedure

## Invocation

```{r}
cat(model@invocation)
```


## fitted parameter values

```{r}
model@results[["par"]]
```


## window sizes and amount of data used to fit

```{r}
counts <- model@counts@counts
head(counts) # for some reason the code doesn't work if we don't print out some of the counts
cat("left window size:", model@counts@leftwin,
    "\ntotal window size:", nchar(rownames(counts)[[1]]))
cat("total counts:", sum(counts))
```


## result of fitting operation

```{r}
cat("convergence: ", model@results$convergence,
    "\nmessage: ", model@results$message)
```

## residuals for sufficiently short T-mers you can look at all of them (2-2? 3-1?)
## the top and bottom residuals for longer T-mers (9-5? 9-9?)
## if present, MCMC traces
## ... and posterior marginal distributions.
